<man>
Welcome to Help Section of Deadline Killer! &#xD; &#xD;We would be following these conventions for all the commands in this application: &#xD;Type -s followed by the priority of the task. &#xD;Type -t followed by deadline of the task. &#xD;Type -d followed by a description of the task. &#xD;Type -n followed by the name of the task. &#xD;The commands are case-sensitive.
</man>

<ls>
Display List of Tasks: &#xD; &#xD;ls &#xD;list &#xD;This command would display the updated list of all the tasks. &#xD;Since the updated task list would be displayed continuously in the Output Box, this command is useful only when the user is in help or Done Tssks view and wishes to view the list of tasks again. The same could be done by pressing the Home button on top left. &#xD;
</ls>

<rm>
Remove Tasks: &#xD; &#xD;rm 20 &#xD;remove 20 &#xD;delete 20 &#xD;del 20 &#xD; &#xD;Either of the above four commands could be used to achieve the same purpose. 20 in the above example is the Task ID created automatically by the system and assigned uniquely to every task.
